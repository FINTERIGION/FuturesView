"""Pydantic request models for the web API.

Responses are deliberately plain dicts (built by each router, run through
``web.serialize.jsonable``) rather than response models: the payloads mirror
whatever the engine already returns (``compute_metrics``'s dict),
and re-declaring their shape here would be a second copy of
core/metrics.py's field list that drifts the moment a field is added there.
Requests get real models because they are hand-authored by this layer and
validation here is what turns a bad form submission into a clean 422 instead
of a traceback three calls deep in the engine.
