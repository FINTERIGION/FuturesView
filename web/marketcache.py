"""LRU cache over ``load_market``.

``load_market`` re-reads every symbol's CSV from disk on every call, which is
fine for a CLI run (one call, then the process exits) but not for a panel
where a user tries several strategies against the same universe/date range
back to back. Nothing downstream writes to a ``MarketData`` -- the engine,
strategies and indicators only read it -- so one cached object can be shared
across requests.
