"""Background job manager for anything too slow to answer within one HTTP
request: a backtest over a long window is a minute or two, and a multi-symbol
data download is close to an hour on a cold cache.

Jobs run on a small thread pool -- pandas/numpy release the GIL for the
heavy lifting, so this genuinely parallelizes rather than just queuing.
Anything the CLI already logs via the ``logging`` module (roll-calendar
notices, warmup warnings, blow-up notices, incomplete-download warnings)
reaches the browser unchanged, because the manager attaches a handler to
the loggers those modules already use and threads it into each job's own
log by thread id.
