    site can POST straight to ``http://127.0.0.1:8000``, and that request's
    Host header is the panel's own. CORS does not stop it either. A POST whose
    body is a type-less Blob goes out with no Content-Type, which makes it a
    "simple" request sent without a preflight -- and FastAPI parses a body
    with no Content-Type as JSON. A page the user merely had open could start
    a forced re-download of every product or write one into the registry.

    What such a request cannot hide is where it came from. Browsers send
    ``Origin`` on every cross-origin POST/PUT/PATCH/DELETE, so a request that
    carries one is accepted only when it names this panel: the same
    ``host[:port]`` the request addressed, or an entry in ``allowed``
    (default ``allowed_origins()``). ``Origin: null`` -- a sandboxed frame, a
    ``no-referrer`` form -- matches neither.

    No ``Origin`` at all means no browser cross-origin fetch: curl, the test
    client, a script, all already running as someone who can reach the port.
