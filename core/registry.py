"""Folder-scan discovery shared by ``strategies/`` and ``indicators/``.

Both packages offer the same deal to a user: write a class, drop the file in
the folder, it shows up. That deal has four details in it that are easy to
get subtly wrong on a second implementation, which is why they live here once
rather than twice:

* a class is registered only where it is *defined*, so an ``import`` at the
  top of a module does not register that module's dependency a second time;
* the base class itself is never registered;
* the short name drops a redundant class-name suffix, but not when doing so
  would leave a single, uninformative word (``MyStrategy`` -> ``my_strategy``,
  not ``my``);
* two classes that reduce to the same short name are refused, never resolved
  by scan order.

Nothing here knows what a strategy or an indicator *is* -- it takes a package
name and a base class and returns what it found.

:func:`reload_package` is the hot-reload half of the same deal, and lives here
for the same reason: ``importlib.reload`` is the obvious way to write it, and
it is subtly wrong for a folder people edit (see there).

    lives somewhere under the package -- private, gitignored modules are
    discovered the same as the bundled examples.

    Two classes whose short names coincide are both left out, and reported as
    a ``ValueError`` against each module involved. Picking one would make the

    user who copied a template file and forgot to rename the class would find
    one of the two quietly running the other's code.

    ``on_error``, when given, is called with ``(module_name, exception)`` for a
    module that fails to import or holds one side of a name clash, and the

    default for a package whose modules are imported by a CLI run that is
    about to use one of them: a silent skip there would look like "strategy
    not found" for what is actually a syntax error. Callers that serve a

    Modules are dropped from ``sys.modules`` and imported fresh rather than
    passed to ``importlib.reload``, which re-executes a module into its
    *existing* namespace: a class the user renamed or deleted survives there
    under its old name, and :func:`discover_subclasses` -- which reads that
    namespace -- would go on listing it, running pre-edit code. Everything is
    dropped before anything is re-imported, so a module that imports a sibling
    (``from .ma import Ma``) binds the fresh sibling rather than the stale one.

    ``base``'s own module is kept because discovery checks
    ``issubclass(obj, base)`` against the class object the caller already
    holds. Re-importing it would mint a new ``base`` that no freshly imported
    subclass descends from, silently emptying the registry.

    ``on_error`` behaves as in :func:`discover_subclasses`. A module that fails
    to import is left out of ``sys.modules`` by the import system itself, so
    the next discovery retries it and reports the same failure, rather than
