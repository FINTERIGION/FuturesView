"""Declarative parameter-range types.

Deliberately dependency-free so ``strategies/`` never has to pull in the
research stack just to say what range a parameter is plausible over. A
``Strategy`` subclass declares that with a class-level
``space: dict[str, Int | Float | Categorical]`` alongside its existing
``params`` defaults. Nothing searches those ranges: ``research.validate``
steps one notch either side of the value in use to check the result does not
hinge on the exact number, and the web panel refuses an indicator param
override from a URL that falls outside them.
