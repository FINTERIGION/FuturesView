"""Four-phase day loop: OPEN -> INTRABAR -> SIGNAL -> SETTLE.

See Execution model in docs/backtest.md. Order routing is contract-agnostic at the point
a strategy calls ``ctx.set_target`` / ``ctx.buy`` / ``ctx.sell`` -- the
engine only resolves *which* calendar contract an order lands on at the
moment it actually fills (``MarketData.contract_by_bar``), so there is no
need to detect and re-route a "signal placed the day before a roll" the way
the old backtrader strategy base had to.
