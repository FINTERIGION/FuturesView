"""Run one backtest and score it: engine + metrics, nothing else.

This lives in ``core`` rather than next to the CLI that used to own it
because ``web.routers.backtest`` calls it per request as well as ``main.py``.
The web layer wants no argparse, results directory, or plotter, and should
not have to import a top-level script to reach a function with no CLI in it.
That import was also a packaging bug: ``pyproject.toml`` ships
``core``/``web`` as packages while the CLI stays a loose module
at the repo root, so an installed copy raised ``ModuleNotFoundError`` the
first time any of them was used.
