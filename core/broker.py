"""Cash, positions, margin, commission, and forced liquidation.

Equity/margin model (Capital limits in docs/backtest.md): margin is never deducted from
cash -- it is only checked as a capital-usage limit. Positions are tracked at
weighted-average cost; every fill that reduces or flips a position realizes
``(fill_price - avg_entry) × sign(position) × closed_qty × multiplier``
straight into cash, and commission is deducted from cash at fill time. That
makes

    equity = cash + Σ_positions (mark - avg_entry) × size × multiplier

self-consistent for both longs and shorts -- there is no separate margin term
riding on the equity curve the way there was with backtrader's
``getvalue()``/``getoperationcost()`` split (an 11-13% error in opposite
directions for longs vs. shorts).
